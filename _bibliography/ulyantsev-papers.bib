    abstract={Bounded synthesis generates a state machine satisfying given temporal specification in linear temporal logic (LTL) while bounding the number of states of the target solution. Bounded synthesis methods currently do not support finite-length behavior examples, which are often helpful when formulating the specification of the desired state machine. In this work we show how to incorporate behavior examples into bounded synthesis methods and exemplify the approach by presenting BeBoSy (Behavior Examples meet BoSy), an extension of the bounded synthesis tool BoSy based on reductions to Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and Quantified Boolean formula satisfiability (QSAT) problems. The proposed approach is to augment encodings used in BoSy with additional constraints that ensure the compliance of the generated state machine with the given behavior examples. Experiments with openly available data from the annual reactive synthesis competition SYNTCOMP augmented with random behavior examples show that the efficiency of the proposed approach is superior to both BoSy (with naïve representation of behavior examples with LTL formulas) and a state-of-the-art counterexample-guided approach EFSM-tools.}

    abstract = "{The demographic history of any population is imprinted in the genomes of the individuals that make up the population. One of the most popular and convenient representations of genetic information is the allele frequency spectrum (AFS), the distribution of allele frequencies in populations. The joint AFS is commonly used to reconstruct the demographic history of multiple populations, and several methods based on diffusion approximation (e.g., ∂a∂i) and ordinary differential equations (e.g., moments) have been developed and applied for demographic inference. These methods provide an opportunity to simulate AFS under a variety of researcher-specified demographic models and to estimate the best model and associated parameters using likelihood-based local optimizations. However, there are no known algorithms to perform global searches of demographic models with a given AFS.Here, we introduce a new method that implements a global search using a genetic algorithm for the automatic and unsupervised inference of demographic history from joint AFS data. Our method is implemented in the software GADMA (Genetic Algorithm for Demographic Model Analysis, https://github.com/ctlab/GADMA).We demonstrate the performance of GADMA by applying it to sequence data from humans and non-model organisms and show that it is able to automatically infer a demographic model close to or even better than the one that was previously obtained manually. Moreover, GADMA is able to infer multiple demographic models at different local optima close to the global one, providing a larger set of possible scenarios to further explore demographic history.}",

    abstract = {Background Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is currently used to treat recurrent clostridial colitis and other diseases. However, neither the therapeutic mechanism of the FMT nor the mechanism that allows the donor bacteria to colonize the intestine of the recipient has yet been described. Moreover, FMT is a great model for studying the ecology of host-associated microbial communities. This creates the need for experimentation with approaches to metagenomic data analysis which may be useful to the interpretation of observed biological phenomena.Methods Here the RECAST (Recipient intestinE Colonisation AnalysiS Tool) computational approach is presented, which is based on the shotgun reads sorting process in accordance with their origin in recipient metagenome. Using the RECAST algorithm, taxonomic/functional annotation, and machine learning, the shotgun metagenomic data from three FMT studies including healthy volunteers, patients with clostridial colitis and metabolic syndrome were analyzed.Results According to the analysis results, the colonizing and remaining microbial diversity in the post-FMT recipient metagenomic samples is clearly separated from the non-colonizers and lost. It is well explained by higher relative abundance in donor/pre-FMT recipient, Human Microbiome project metagenomes, and taxonomy. Moreover, the colonizing and remaining microbes are associated with lantibiotic and tetracyclines resistance genes.Conclusion Based on obtained results, the previously proposed {\textquotedblleft}core{\textquotedblright} human gut microbiome concept may be elaborated. The top microbes of gut microbiota form {\textquotedblleft}cores{\textquotedblright}, which, moreover, are mutually integrable between humans. Also, we assume that redistribution of microbial diversity in post-FMT recipients{\textquoteright} metagenomes is due to competition of donor/recipient microbes and to host immunity. The associations of top gut microbes with lantibiotic/antibiotic resistance can be related to gut microbiota colonization resistance phenomena or anthropogenic impact.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.FMTfecal microbiota transplantation.IBDinflammatory bowel disease.GRMgenome-resolved metagenomics.NMDSNon-metric multidimensional scaling.CDIClostridioides difficile infection.SNVSingle nucleotide variant.WGSWhole genome sequencing.MSmetabolic syndrome.KEGGkyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes.KOKEGG orthology.ARantibiotic resistance.},

In recent years, the use of SAT and SMT solvers for the minimum size DFA inference problem (MinDFA) enabled significant performance improvements. Nevertheless, there are many problems that are simply too difficult to solve to optimality with existing technologies. One fundamental difficulty of the MinDFA problem is the size of the search space. Moreover, another fundamental drawback of these approaches is the encoding size. This paper develops novel compact encodings for Symmetry Breaking of SAT-based approaches to MinDFA. The proposed encodings are shown to perform comparably in practice with the most efficient, but also significantly larger, symmetry breaking encodings.",

In particular, SAT-based guess-and-determine attacks studied in the context of algebraic cryptanalysis. Each of these attacks is built upon some set of Boolean variables, thus it can be specified by a Boolean vector. We use two general evolutionary strategies to find an optimal vector: (1+1)-EA and GA. Based on these strategies parallel algorithms (based on modern SAT-solvers) for solving the problem of minimization of a special pseudo-Boolean function are implemented. This function is a fitness function used to evaluate the runtime of a guess-and-determine attack. We compare the efficiency of (1+1)-EA and GA with the algorithm from the Tabu search class, that was earlier used to solve related problems. Our GA-based solution showed the best results on a number of test instances, namely, cryptanalysis problems of several stream ciphers (cryptographic keystream generators).",

Although the corresponding satisfiability problems are hard, their difficulty can often be lowered by choosing a set of variables to brute force over, and by solving each of the corresponding reduced problems using a SAT solver, which is called the guess-and-determine attack. In many successful cipher breaking attempts this set was chosen analytically, however, the nature of the problem makes evolutionary computation a good choice.We investigate one particular method for constructing guess-and-determine attacks based on evolutionary algorithms. This method estimates the fitness of a particular guessed bit set by Monte-Carlo simulations. We show that using statistical tests within the comparator of fitness values, which can be used to reduce the necessary number of samples, together with a dynamic strategy for the upper limit on the number of samples, speeds up the attack by a factor of 1.5 to 4.3 even on a distributed cluster.},

It is important to develop tools for identifying the mechanisms of how resistance is transmitted between gut microbial species and pathogens.We developed MetaCherchant—an algorithm for extracting the genomic environment of antibiotic resistance genes from metagenomic data in the form of a graph. The algorithm was validated on a number of simulated and published datasets, as well as applied to new ‘shotgun’ metagenomes of gut microbiota from patients with Helicobacter pylori who underwent antibiotic therapy. Genomic context was reconstructed for several major resistance genes. Taxonomic annotation of the context suggests that within a single metagenome, the resistance genes can be contained in genomes of multiple species. MetaCherchant allows reconstruction of mobile elements with resistance genes within the genomes of bacteria using metagenomic data. Application of MetaCherchant in differential mode produced specific graph structures suggesting the evidence of possible resistance gene transmission within a mobile element that occurred as a result of the antibiotic therapy. MetaCherchant is a promising tool giving researchers an opportunity to get an insight into dynamics of resistance transmission in vivo basing on metagenomic data.Source code and binaries are freely available for download at https://github.com/ctlab/metacherchant.

They are often used in formal verification and also can serve as visual software models. The latter application is associated with the problems of software synthesis and automatic derivation of software models from specification. Smaller synthesized models are more general and are easier to comprehend, yet the problem of minimum FSM identification has received little attention in previous research. This paper presents four exact methods to tackle the problem of minimum FSM identification from a set of test scenarios and a temporal specification represented in linear temporal logic. The methods are implemented as an open-source tool. Three of them are based on translations of the FSM identification problem to SAT or QSAT problem instances. Accounting for temporal properties is done via counterexample prohibition. Counterexamples are either obtained from previously identified FSMs, or based on bounded model checking. The fourth method uses backtracking. The proposed methods are evaluated on several case studies and on a larger number of randomly generated instances of increasing complexity. The results show that the Iterative SAT-based method is the leader among the proposed methods. The methods are also compared with existing inexact approaches, i.e., the ones which do not necessarily identify the minimum FSM, and these comparisons show encouraging results.},

The NP-hard DFA identification problem can be efficiently solved by translation to the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). Previously we developed a technique to reduce the problem search space by enforcing DFA states to be enumerated in breadth-first search (BFS) order. We proposed symmetry breaking predicates, which can be added to Boolean formulae representing various automata identification problems. In this paper we continue the study of SAT-based approaches. First, we propose new predicates based on depth-first search order. Second, we present three methods to identify all non-isomorphic automata of the minimum size instead of just one---the P-complete problem which has not been solved before. Third, we revisited our implementation of the BFS-based approach and conducted new evaluation experiments. It occurs that BFS-based approach outperforms all other exact algorithms for DFA identification and can be effectively applied for finding all solutions of the problem.",

    abstract = "{Motivation: High-throughput metagenomic sequencing has revolutionized our view on the structure and metabolic potential of microbial communities. However, analysis of metagenomic composition is often complicated by the high complexity of the community and the lack of related reference genomic sequences. As a start point for comparative metagenomic analysis, the researchers require efficient means for assessing pairwise similarity of the metagenomes (beta-diversity). A number of approaches were used to address this task, however, most of them have inherent disadvantages that limit their scope of applicability. For instance, the reference-based methods poorly perform on metagenomes from previously unstudied niches, while composition-based methods appear to be too abstract for straightforward interpretation and do not allow to identify the differentially abundant features.Results: We developed MetaFast, an approach that allows to represent a shotgun metagenome from an arbitrary environment as a modified de Bruijn graph consisting of simplified components. For multiple metagenomes, the resulting representation is used to obtain a pairwise similarity matrix. The dimensional structure of the metagenomic components preserved in our algorithm reflects the inherent subspecies-level diversity of microbiota. The method is computationally efficient and especially promising for an analysis of metagenomes from novel environmental niches.Availability and Implementation: Source code and binaries are freely available for download at https://github.com/ctlab/metafast. The code is written in Java and is platform independent (tested on Linux and Windows x86\_64). Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

Feature extraction facilitates classification, clustering and model analysis for testing and refining biological hypotheses. “Shotgun” metagenome is an analytically challenging type of genomic data - containing sequences of all genes from the totality of a complex microbial community. Recently, researchers started to analyze metagenomes using reference-free methods based on the analysis of oligonucleotides (k-mers) frequency spectrum previously applied to isolated genomes. However, little is known about their correlation with the existing approaches for metagenomic feature extraction, as well as the limits of applicability.

It is a modification of the previously proposed approaches based on the genetic and ant colony optimization algorithms. Changes include a new way of representing machines and improving the fitness function. The method makes it possible to generate machines whose behavior is more consistent with training examples than the behavior of machines generated by the known approaches.},

Contrary to model-based testing (MBT), the paper focuses on implementation coverage, not model coverage. An approach based on evolutionary algorithms is presented which generates coverage test suites for both basic and composite IEC 61499 function blocks. It employs two third-party tools, FBDK and EvoSuite. The evaluation of the approach was performed on a set of control applications for two lab-scale demonstration plants. Results show that the approach is applicable and shows good performance at least on basic function blocks. The generated tests suites helped to discover several unreachable system parts, which pinpointed errors in the systems under test.},

We propose symmetry breaking predicates, which can be added to Boolean formulae representing various DFA identification problems. We show how to apply this technique to DFA identification from both noiseless and noisy data. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that it allows to exactly determine the existence or non-existence of a solution of the noisy DFA identification problem.},

    abstract={This paper is dedicated to the problem of learning finite-state machines (FSMs), which plays a key role in automata-based programming. Metaheuristic algorithms commonly applied to this problem often use FSM mutations (small changes in the FSM structure) for solution construction. Most of them do not employ the specifics of FSMs in their work. We propose a new simple method for improving performance of these algorithms. The basic idea is to mark those transitions of FSMs that were used during fitness evaluation. Then, if a FSM mutation changes a transition that was not used in fitness evaluation, the fitness function value need not be calculated for the mutated FSM. This observation allows to conserve fitness evaluations, which often have high computational costs. The proposed method has been incorporated into several traditional and recent FSM learning algorithms based on evolutionary strategies, genetic algorithms and ant colony optimization. Experimental results are reported showing that the new method significantly improves performance of two methods based on evolutionary strategies and ant colony optimization.},

The third recently introduced mutation-based ACO algorithm employs another problem mapping, where construction graph nodes represent complete solutions. Here, ants travel between solutions to find the optimal one. In this paper we try to take a step back from the mutation-based ACO to find out if classical ACO algorithms can be used for learning FSMs. It was shown that classical ACO algorithms are inefficient for the problem of learning FSMs in comparison to the mutation-based ACO algorithm.},

We present a new method of Extended Finite-State Machines (EFSM) induction based on an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm (ACO) and a new meaningful test-based crossover operator for EFSMs. New algorithms are compared with a genetic algorithm (GA) using a traditional crossover, a (1+1) evolutionary strategy and a random mutation hill climber. This comparison shows that the use of test-based crossover greatly improves performance of GA. GA on average also significantly outperforms the hill climber and evolutionary strategy. ACO outperforms GA, and the difference between average performance of ACO and GA hybridized with hill climber is insignificant.},
