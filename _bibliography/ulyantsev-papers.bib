    abstract = "{The demographic history of any population is imprinted in the genomes of the individuals that make up the population. One of the most popular and convenient representations of genetic information is the allele frequency spectrum (AFS), the distribution of allele frequencies in populations. The joint AFS is commonly used to reconstruct the demographic history of multiple populations, and several methods based on diffusion approximation (e.g., ∂a∂i) and ordinary differential equations (e.g., moments) have been developed and applied for demographic inference. These methods provide an opportunity to simulate AFS under a variety of researcher-specified demographic models and to estimate the best model and associated parameters using likelihood-based local optimizations. However, there are no known algorithms to perform global searches of demographic models with a given AFS.Here, we introduce a new method that implements a global search using a genetic algorithm for the automatic and unsupervised inference of demographic history from joint AFS data. Our method is implemented in the software GADMA (Genetic Algorithm for Demographic Model Analysis, https://github.com/ctlab/GADMA).We demonstrate the performance of GADMA by applying it to sequence data from humans and non-model organisms and show that it is able to automatically infer a demographic model close to or even better than the one that was previously obtained manually. Moreover, GADMA is able to infer multiple demographic models at different local optima close to the global one, providing a larger set of possible scenarios to further explore demographic history.}",

Metasurfaces and other planar devices based on all-dielectric nanoparticles lead to manage the light propagation at the nanoscale. Impressive effects such as perfect absorption, invisibility, chirality effects, negative refraction, light focusing in the area with size smaller than wavelength, nano-lasing etc - can be achieved with all-dielectric technologies. While it is needed to use more and more complicated designs for solution of modern nanophotonics’ currents tasks, non-classical methods of optimization become relevant. For example, to design reconfigurable metalenses with an additional degree of freedom such as polarizability or temperature dependence, evolutionary or genetic algorithms show their high applicability. In this work, we show a new approach to design metalenses with evolutionary and genetic algorithms.}

    abstract = {Background Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is currently used to treat recurrent clostridial colitis and other diseases. However, neither the therapeutic mechanism of the FMT nor the mechanism that allows the donor bacteria to colonize the intestine of the recipient has yet been described. Moreover, FMT is a great model for studying the ecology of host-associated microbial communities. This creates the need for experimentation with approaches to metagenomic data analysis which may be useful to the interpretation of observed biological phenomena.Methods Here the RECAST (Recipient intestinE Colonisation AnalysiS Tool) computational approach is presented, which is based on the shotgun reads sorting process in accordance with their origin in recipient metagenome. Using the RECAST algorithm, taxonomic/functional annotation, and machine learning, the shotgun metagenomic data from three FMT studies including healthy volunteers, patients with clostridial colitis and metabolic syndrome were analyzed.Results According to the analysis results, the colonizing and remaining microbial diversity in the post-FMT recipient metagenomic samples is clearly separated from the non-colonizers and lost. It is well explained by higher relative abundance in donor/pre-FMT recipient, Human Microbiome project metagenomes, and taxonomy. Moreover, the colonizing and remaining microbes are associated with lantibiotic and tetracyclines resistance genes.Conclusion Based on obtained results, the previously proposed {\textquotedblleft}core{\textquotedblright} human gut microbiome concept may be elaborated. The top microbes of gut microbiota form {\textquotedblleft}cores{\textquotedblright}, which, moreover, are mutually integrable between humans. Also, we assume that redistribution of microbial diversity in post-FMT recipients{\textquoteright} metagenomes is due to competition of donor/recipient microbes and to host immunity. The associations of top gut microbes with lantibiotic/antibiotic resistance can be related to gut microbiota colonization resistance phenomena or anthropogenic impact.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.FMTfecal microbiota transplantation.IBDinflammatory bowel disease.GRMgenome-resolved metagenomics.NMDSNon-metric multidimensional scaling.CDIClostridioides difficile infection.SNVSingle nucleotide variant.WGSWhole genome sequencing.MSmetabolic syndrome.KEGGkyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes.KOKEGG orthology.ARantibiotic resistance.},

Such data are crucial for medical genetics and essential for studying population history. The Genome Russia Project aims at filling this gap by performing whole genome sequencing and analysis of peoples of the Russian Federation. Here we report the characterization of genome-wide variation of 264 healthy adults, including 60 newly sequenced samples. People of Russia carry known and novel genetic variants of adaptive, clinical and functional consequence that in many cases show allele frequency divergence from neighboring populations. Population genetics analyses revealed six phylogeographic partitions among indigenous ethnicities corresponding to their geographic locales. This study presents a characterization of population-specific genomic variation in Russia with results important for medical genetics and for understanding the dynamic population history of the world's largest country."

Although the corresponding satisfiability problems are hard, their difficulty can often be lowered by choosing a set of variables to brute force over, and by solving each of the corresponding reduced problems using a SAT solver, which is called the guess-and-determine attack. In many successful cipher breaking attempts this set was chosen analytically, however, the nature of the problem makes evolutionary computation a good choice.We investigate one particular method for constructing guess-and-determine attacks based on evolutionary algorithms. This method estimates the fitness of a particular guessed bit set by Monte-Carlo simulations. We show that using statistical tests within the comparator of fitness values, which can be used to reduce the necessary number of samples, together with a dynamic strategy for the upper limit on the number of samples, speeds up the attack by a factor of 1.5 to 4.3 even on a distributed cluster.},

    abstract="In this paper we present the results on applying evolutionary computation techniques to construction of several cryptographic attacks. In particular, SAT-based guess-and-determine attacks studied in the context of algebraic cryptanalysis. Each of these attacks is built upon some set of Boolean variables, thus it can be specified by a Boolean vector. We use two general evolutionary strategies to find an optimal vector: (1+1)-EA and GA. Based on these strategies parallel algorithms (based on modern SAT-solvers) for solving the problem of minimization of a special pseudo-Boolean function are implemented. This function is a fitness function used to evaluate the runtime of a guess-and-determine attack. We compare the efficiency of (1+1)-EA and GA with the algorithm from the Tabu search class, that was earlier used to solve related problems. Our GA-based solution showed the best results on a number of test instances, namely, cryptanalysis problems of several stream ciphers (cryptographic keystream generators).",

    abstract = "{Antibiotic resistance is an important global public health problem. Human gut microbiota is an accumulator of resistance genes potentially providing them to pathogens. It is important to develop tools for identifying the mechanisms of how resistance is transmitted between gut microbial species and pathogens.We developed MetaCherchant—an algorithm for extracting the genomic environment of antibiotic resistance genes from metagenomic data in the form of a graph. The algorithm was validated on a number of simulated and published datasets, as well as applied to new ‘shotgun’ metagenomes of gut microbiota from patients with Helicobacter pylori who underwent antibiotic therapy. Genomic context was reconstructed for several major resistance genes. Taxonomic annotation of the context suggests that within a single metagenome, the resistance genes can be contained in genomes of multiple species. MetaCherchant allows reconstruction of mobile elements with resistance genes within the genomes of bacteria using metagenomic data. Application of MetaCherchant in differential mode produced specific graph structures suggesting the evidence of possible resistance gene transmission within a mobile element that occurred as a result of the antibiotic therapy. MetaCherchant is a promising tool giving researchers an opportunity to get an insight into dynamics of resistance transmission in vivo basing on metagenomic data.Source code and binaries are freely available for download at https://github.com/ctlab/metacherchant. The code is written in Java and is platform-independent.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
