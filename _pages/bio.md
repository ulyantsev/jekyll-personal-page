Vladimir Ulyantsev is a PhD in computer science (candidate of technical sciences in Russia), 
head of the international [research center “Computer Technologies”](https://ctlab.ifmo.ru/en/), 
associate professor and deputy dean of the [Information Technologies and Programming Faculty](https://ditp.ifmo.ru/en/).

In 2007, he graduated from [St. Petersburg’s Presidential Physics and Mathematics Lyceum No. 239](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg_Lyceum_239) 
and spent the following eight and a half years at ITMO University’s Computer Technologies Department. 
He completed his Bachelor’s studies there in 2011, and his Master’s studies – in 2013. 

Vladimir Ulyantsev started his career as a senior laboratory assistant in 2008, having been invited by 
[Fedor Tsarev](https://www.facebook.com/fedor.tsarev.3) to join the development and organization of programming contests and championships. 
In the five years that followed, Vladimir Ulyantsev actively participated in the contests’ organization. 
He also contributed to the organization of the Summer Informatics School – one time as a PE instructor and three times as a teacher. 

In 2010, he began participating in scientific activities under the supervision of Fedor Tsarev and 
[Anatoly Shalyto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Shalyto), 
as well as in applying for and conducting work as part of various grants of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research 
and other agencies on the topic of automated synthesis of finite-state machines. 

Since 2011, Vladimir Ulyantsev has been publishing papers in international journals, presenting his research at Russian 
and international conferences, and supervising term and Bachelor’s projects. 
His main research topic is the application of SAT and CSP solvers for solving NP-hard combinatorial problems. 

In 2013, Vladimir Ulyantsev started his PhD studies with an internship at the 
[Federal Research and Clinical Center of Physical-Chemical Medicine](http://rcpcm.org/home/) in Moscow. 
Since then, along with his main research topic he has been engaged in the field of bioinformatics, 
namely the computational approaches for comparative metagenomics. 
In the course of his collaboration with the institute, he developed [MetaFast](https://github.com/ctlab/metafast) 
and [MetaCherchant](https://github.com/ctlab/metacherchant) tools and published several 
papers in the leading bioinformatics journals Bioinformatics and BMC Bioinformatics.

In 2013, Vladimir Ulyantsev was among the first to join the international research laboratory “Computer Technologies”, 
founded alongside with the start of the Project 5-100 on the faculty’s basis under the guidance 
of [Vladimir Parfenov](https://en.itmo.ru/en/viewperson/68/Vladimir_Parfenov.htm). 
Together with [Daniil Chivilikhin](http://ctlab.itmo.ru/~chivdan/), starting from 2014 Vladimir Ulyantsev has been heading the discrete optimization research group.

In 2015, Vladimir defended his [PhD thesis]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/phd) titled “Finite-state machine synthesis using SAT and CSP solvers”, 
supervised by Anatoly Shalyto. Since 2016, he has been working as an associate professor at the Information Technologies and Programming Faculty. 

From May 2014, Vladimir Ulyantsev has been heading projects supported by various Russian scientific foundations: 
Russian Foundation for Basic Research [project No. 14-07-31337 (2014-2015)](https://www.rfbr.ru/rffi/portal/project_search/o_1911929) (in Russian), 
Russian Science Foundation [project No. 18-71-00150 (2018-2020)](https://rscf.ru/en/contests/search-projects/18-71-00150/), 
and Russian Foundation for Basic Research [project No. 18-07-01285 (2018-2020)](https://www.rfbr.ru/rffi/ru/project_search/o_2071392) (in Russian). 
From 2016 to 2019, he was an executive appointee of an [international project](http://is.ifmo.ru/fcntp-aalto/) (in Russian) 
in collaboration with [Valery Vyatkin](http://www.vyatkin.org/)’s group at Aalto University, Finland. Since 2016, he has been supervising student research supported by JetBrains Research. 

In 2018, after the merger of several laboratories, Vladimir Ulyantsev was appointed the head of the international research center “Computer Technologies”. 
In early 2020, together with [Alexey Sergushichev](https://ctlab.itmo.ru/~alserg/) and [Stephen O’Brien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_J._O%27Brien), 
he set up the Laboratory of Genomic Diversity on the faculty’s basis. 
Since 2020, Vladimir has been holding the position of the deputy dean for science at the Information Technologies and Programming Faculty. 

In recent years, Vladimir has been taking great pleasure in delivering scientific and popular science lectures at schools and on various open stages, 
including the Presidential Physics and Mathematics Lyceum No. 239, Sirius education center, New Holland’s Open Lecture Hall, Science Fest, and others. 
He has also been contributing to the maintenance of the laboratory’s accounts on 
[VK](https://vk.com/itmo.ctlab), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/itmo.ctlab/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/itmo.ctlab/) (all in Russian). 

Vladimir Ulyantsev is the co-author of over 45 international publications
