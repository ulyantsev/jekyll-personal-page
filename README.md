# Vladimir Ulyantsev' personal webpage.

At least I've tried.

Decided to use ai-folio theme. There are other cool example of usage I can mention:
[Maruan Al-Shedivat](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mshediva/),
[Andreea Bobu](https://andreea7b.github.io/),
[Alexey Ignatiev](https://alexeyignatiev.github.io/).

# TODO

* support both RU and EN -- in some future
* Generate CV as well, good example located here https://otiliastr.github.io/cv/
* think about ulyantsev.org, probably https://devopsx.com/static-website-hosting-in-2019/ would help
