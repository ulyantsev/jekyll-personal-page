# Vladimir Ulyantsev' personal webpage.

*At least I've tried.*

Decided to use ai-folio theme. There are other cool example of usage I can mention:
[Maruan Al-Shedivat](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mshediva/),
[Andreea Bobu](https://andreea7b.github.io/),
[Alexey Ignatiev](https://alexeyignatiev.github.io/).
Another jekyll nice page: [Dominik Moritz](https://www.domoritz.de/).

# TODO

* Educational papers
* Find a place for papers in Russian

* Find a place for programms certificates (only in Russian CV?)

* support both RU and EN -- in some future
* Generate CV as well, good example located here https://otiliastr.github.io/cv/
